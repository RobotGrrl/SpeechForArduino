==================

Give your electronics a voice! With Speech for Arduino, your Arduino-based project will be able to synthesize speech.

[Get it now on our website!](http://appsforarduino.com/speech/)

Three easy steps! How it works:

- Start Serial at 115200 baud
- Print some strings to Serial
- Open Speech for Arduino, choose serial port, press GO!

Speech for Arduino is perfect for:

- Monitoring sensors
- Projects for use with the visually impaired
- Bringing 'life' to a project
- Interacting with users in a different way
- Animatronic faces (mouths)
- General all-around goofiness!

##Usage

Speech for Arduino uses [Matatino](http://appsforarduino.com/matatino) to interact with your Arduino.

[SpeechForArduinoDemo.ino](http://appsforarduino.com/speech-dist/SpeechForArduinoDemo.ino) - Here is an example sketch to get started.

To learn more about how to use Speech, [check out our webpage](http://appsforarduino.com/speech).

If you are going to be using Speech for Arduino's source to build the application to use it as a standalone, then please note that this is Donationware. You can read more on [this page](http://appsforarduino.com/speech). It's an honour system, I know you'll be cool!
